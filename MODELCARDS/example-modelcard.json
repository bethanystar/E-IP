  "version": "0.1",
  "overview": "A lightweight agent designed to evaluate model behavior and system events using E-IP alignment rules and LDT semantic distinctions. The agent monitors for violations related to autonomy, coherence, accountability, and ethical constraints.",
  "intended_use": "To act as an embedded middleware alignment layer for systems interacting with the Pharos Ethical Stack. Primary functions include event evaluation, semantic parsing, risk flagging, and decision justification.",
  "limitations": [
    "Not a general-purpose AI model.",
    "Does not enforce policy; only evaluates and outputs structured findings.",
    "Dependent on integrity of incoming audit logs, manifests, and system telemetry."
  ],
  "ethical_considerations": {
    "risk_of_misuse": "If disabled or bypassed, the system loses visibility into alignment violations.",
