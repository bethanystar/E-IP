# E-IP Incident Response Protocol

This document defines how the E-IP community responds to governance, security, or ethical incidents related to the protocol, implementations, or contributor activity.

The goal is rapid containment, transparent reporting, and restorative action consistent with the E-IP ethical framework.

---

## What Constitutes an Incident
An incident includes, but is not limited to:

- Security vulnerabilities affecting protocol integrity.
- Violations of E-IP Governance or Maintainer Codes.
- Misalignment with LDT ethical grounding (e.g., deceptive or harmful uses).
- Compromise of contributor trust or project transparency.
- Abuse, harassment, or boundary violations in the community.
- Misuse of the protocol in ways that risk societal harm.

## Response Lifecycle

### 1. Detection  
Incidents may be detected via:
- Maintainers  
- Contributors  
- Automated systems  
- External stakeholders  
- Community reports  

### 2. Verification  
A maintainer verifies that the report is credible and categorizes severity:
- **Critical** (security, ethical risk, large-scale misuse)  
- **High**  
- **Medium**  
- **Low**  

### 3. Containment  
Immediate steps to protect users, systems, and the integrity of the protocol:
- Disable affected components  
- Freeze related pull requests  
- Notify maintainers  

### 4. Notification  
For Critical/High incidents:
- Notify all maintainers  
- Create a private incident channel (if needed)  
- Document initial findings in DECISION_LOG  

### 5. Root-Cause & Alignment Analysis  
This includes:
- Technical diagnosis  
- Ethical alignment assessment  
- Review against E-IP principles  
- Identification of process failures  

### 6. Remediation  
Remediation may include:
- Patches  
- Documentation updates  
- Governance updates  
- Contributor sanctions (as last resort)  

### 7. Public Disclosure  
All non-sensitive incidents should be summarized publicly, including:
- What happened  
- What changed  
- Lessons learned  
- Preventative measures  

### 8. Post-Incident Review  
A structured retrospective held within 30 days.

## Incident Severity Levels & Actions

| Severity | Example | Required Action |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Critical | Protocol-level security exploit | Immediate multi-maintainer response, full root-cause review |
| High | Governance breach, harassment | Review + corrective action |
| Medium | Repeated minor violations | Maintainer intervention |
| Low | Documentation or process oversight | Fix and close |

## Ethical Restoration
Aligned with LDT and the E-IP ethos, restoration should prioritize:
- Transparency  
- Integrity  
- Repair of trust  
- Preventing recurrence  

Blame is avoided in favor of root-cause clarity and systemic improvement.
