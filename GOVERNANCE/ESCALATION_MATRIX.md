# E-IP Escalation Matrix

This document outlines how unresolved issues, disputes, governance breakdowns, or protocol-related risks escalate through clearly defined authority layers.

It ensures that disagreements or deadlocks do not stall progress or compromise project integrity.

---

# Escalation Tiers

## **Tier 1 — Contributor Level**
Issues are first discussed between involved contributors.

Handled via:
- Pull Request comments  
- GitHub issues  
- Direct conversation (as appropriate)  

If unresolved after **3 attempts or 7 days**, escalate to Tier 2.

---

## **Tier 2 — Maintainer Review**
A maintainer steps in to:
- Facilitate discussion  
- Clarify governance rules  
- Identify misalignment  
- Recommend options  

Maintainer decisions are binding unless:
- A contributor requests Tier 3 review  
- The decision affects protocol architecture or ethics  

---

## **Tier 3 — Governance Council Review**
Complex issues go to the **Governance Council**, which includes:
- Lead maintainers  
- Alignment reviewers  
- Optional outside advisors (case-based)

Used for:
- Conflicting interpretations of E-IP principles  
- Major architectural disagreements  
- Ethical or societal risk concerns  
- Any incident that may impact public trust  

Council decisions require:
- 2/3 majority for approval  
- Minority report optional  

---

## **Tier 4 — Alignment & Ethics Tribunal (AET)**
Reserved for:
- Misuse that risks societal harm  
- Repeated ethical violations  
- Severe governance misconduct  
- Alignment failures that breach LDT foundational principles  
- Organizational attempts to co-opt or distort the protocol  

The AET may:
- Suspend contributors  
- Freeze protocol updates  
- Recommend structural governance changes  

This tier ensures E-IP cannot be politically captured, misused, or ethically degraded.

# Escalation Timeframes

| Tier | Maximum Response Time |
|------|------------------------|
| Tier 1 | 7 days |
| Tier 2 | 5 days |
| Tier 3 | 14 days |
| Tier 4 | 30 days |

---

# Documentation
Every escalation at Tier 2+ must be documented in:
- **DECISION_LOG.md**
- Linked GitHub issues or PRs
- Additional supporting evidence as needed

---

# Guiding Principles
Escalation decisions must always reflect:
- Transparency  
- Accountability  
- Alignment with LDT  
- Protection of users and society  
- Prevention of misuse  
- Minimizing harm  
- Restorative, not punitive, action
