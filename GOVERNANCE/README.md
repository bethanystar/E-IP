# E-IP Governance Framework

This folder defines how decisions are made, evaluated, documented, and escalated across the Pharos Ethical Stack (E-IP). While E-IP provides protocol-level primitives for alignment and ethical safeguards, this governance layer defines **the meta-rules**: how changes to the specification occur, how contributors participate, and how disputes or ambiguity are resolved.

The governance model blends:
- Lightweight open-source process (similar to IETF + CNCF)
- Alignment-first oversight (using E-IP’s own Alignment and Semantic protocols)
- Transparent documentation (Decision Logs, Manifests, Model Cards)

This folder contains:
- `GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`  
- `MAINTAINERS.md`  
- `CHANGE_CONTROL.md`  
- `ALIGNMENT_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`  
- `GOVERNANCE_GLOSSARY.md`

All governance processes are designed to be *practical*, *implementable*, and *minimally bureaucratic*, while prioritizing **safety**, **ethical coherence**, and **transparent evolution**.
