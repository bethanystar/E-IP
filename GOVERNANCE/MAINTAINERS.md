# Maintainers — PHAROS Ethical Stack (E-IP / LDT Protocols)

This document defines the responsibilities, expectations, and operating norms for maintainers of the PHAROS Ethical Stack.

## 1. Purpose of Maintainers

Maintainers are the technical and ethical stewards of the repository.  
They ensure:
- Code quality  
- Spec stability  
- Ethical alignment  
- Transparent decision-making  
- Consistent releases  

They do **not** own the project — they serve the community and the protocol.

## 2. Responsibilities

### 2.1 Technical Responsibilities
- Review pull requests  
- Enforce schema and spec consistency  
- Ensure all changes meet contribution guidelines  
- Validate protocol integrity, security, and interoperability  
- Approve, reject, or request changes on RFCs  
- Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible

## 3. Ethical Responsibilities

All maintainers must:
- Uphold the PHAROS Ethical Stack principles  
- Evaluate changes for semantic drift  
- Protect human safety, agency, and transparency  
- Document ethical considerations for all major decisions

## 4. Decision Authority

Maintainers act via **rough consensus**.  
When consensus cannot be reached:
- The **Lead Maintainer** issues the final decision  
- All objections MUST be recorded in the Decision Log

The Lead Maintainer:
- Breaks decision deadlocks  
- Owns release cadence  
- Ensures RFCs move through the workflow

The Lead Maintainer **cannot** overrule RFC requirements or ethical alignment checks.
