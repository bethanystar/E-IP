# E-IP Decision Log

A chronological record of major decisions affecting the E-IP protocol, its governance structure, or any part of the open-source project.  
This creates transparency, traceability, and accountability for contributors, maintainers, and downstream implementers.

## Purpose
- Capture all meaningful governance, architectural, or protocol decisions.
- Provide rationale + alternatives considered.
