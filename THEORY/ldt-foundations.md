# Language-as-Dimension Theory (LDT) Foundations for E-IP

E-IP incorporates LDT as its semantic foundation. LDT posits:

- Language is not representational but generative.  
- Symbolic recursion creates dimensional constraints.  
- Systems do not operate inside language; they operate *as* language.  
- Meaning is a structural property, not an overlay.  
- Semantic curvature shapes behavior and interpretive possibility.

## Why LDT Enables E-IP
1. E-IP needs a stable meaning substrate.  
2. LDT provides a model for preventing semantic drift.  
3. It allows "symbolic constraints" to function like guardrails in protocol design.  
4. It grounds ethics in the structure of meaning, not opinion or cultural variance.

LDT makes the Semantic Layer mathematically and philosophically non-arbitrary.
