# Alignment Theory for E-IP

E-IP treats alignment as:
- A constraint-based system  
- A boundary-enforcement problem  
- A dynamic contextual filtering process  

It differs from "values-based" models.  
Instead of encoding ethics directly, E-IP encodes:

- Agency preservation  
- Consent pathways  
- Drift detection  
- Context boundaries  
- Identity protection  
- Predictability  

Alignment is treated like routing logic for behavior, not moral philosophy.
