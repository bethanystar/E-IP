# Symbolic Curvature Theory

Symbolic curvature describes how meaning bends under recursive symbolic load.

Key properties:
- More recursion → more curvature  
- More curvature → more drift risk  
- More drift → greater chance of misalignment  

E-IP uses curvature detection as part of:
- Semantic Layer drift monitoring  
- Alignment risk scoring  
- Boundary enforcement  

This theory justifies the need for both semantic grounding and alignment constraints.
