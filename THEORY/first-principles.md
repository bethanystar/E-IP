# First Principles of E-IP

1. **All behavior is interpretation**  
   Systems act based on meaning structures.

2. **Meaning must be grounded**  
   Loose semantics produce unsafe behavior.

3. **Ethics is context, not preference**  
   Alignment is boundary control, not moral encoding.

4. **Systems must be transparent**  
   Intent, rationale, and behavior must be externally auditable.

5. **Governance is part of the architecture**  
   To prevent drift at the protocol level.

6. **Open-source is required**  
   E-IP must be publicly inspectable to function.
