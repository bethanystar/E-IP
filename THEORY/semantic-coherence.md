# Semantic Coherence Theory

Semantic coherence is the requirement that:
- Every term means the same thing across time, space, and implementation.
- Every protocol component references the same definitional substrate.
- Meaning is stable enough to evaluate ethical risk.

E-IP uses semantic coherence to:
- Prevent manipulative re-interpretation of terms  
- Reduce ambiguity in alignment decisions  
- Ensure cross-system interoperability  
- Maintain consistent interpretation of manifests and decisions
