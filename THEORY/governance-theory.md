# Governance as a Protocol Layer

Governance is not administrative overhead.  
In E-IP it is a structural layer because:

1. It determines how the protocol evolves.  
2. It maintains coherence across layers.  
3. It regulates semantic and alignment changes.  
4. It ensures transparency and auditability.  
5. It is required for legitimacy and global adoption.

Governance is part of the protocol, not outside it.
