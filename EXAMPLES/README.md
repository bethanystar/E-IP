# EXAMPLES

This directory contains practical, minimal examples demonstrating how to use,
extend, and implement E-IP components in real-world environments.

The examples included here serve several purposes:
- Help developers understand correct use of E-IP schemas
- Show policy and governance contributors how protocol artifacts fit together
- Demonstrate semantic-layer workflows using LDT (Language-as-Dimension Theory)
- Provide templates for production implementations
- Offer reference artifacts for audits, evaluations, and compliance checks

Each example is intentionally lightweight and self-contained.

## Included Example Types

1. **Example Manifest**
   - Shows how a system self-attests to capabilities, constraints, and alignment properties.

2. **Example Model Card**
   - Demonstrates a standardized documentation template for any agent or model.

3. **Example Decision Log**
   - Provides a full audit record of why a protocol decision was made.

4. **E-IP Event Example**
   - Example of a semantic trace, alignment check, or governance event emitted by a system.

5. **Semantic Evaluation Example (LDT-Based)**
   - Shows how a system processes symbolic distinctions and produces a clarity score.

6. **Alignment Compliance Example**
   - Demonstrates a pass/fail evaluation using E-IP alignment rules.

7. **Governance Cycle Example**
   - Illustrates how decisions progress from proposal → review → approval → logging.

Each file is meant to be used as a template for new E-IP implementations.
