# RFC 0002 — E-IP Semantic Architecture & Alignment Boundary Layer (ABL)
**Category:** Standards Track  
**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** 2025-12-03  
**Author:** Pharos Society / Bethany W.  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Depends on:** RFC-0001 (Governance Framework)

# 1. Summary
This RFC defines the **Semantic Architecture** and the **Alignment Boundary Layer (ABL)** that form the core of the Ethical Internet Protocol (E-IP).  
The ABL ensures **meaning-preservation**, **ethical integrity**, and **semantic stability** across all E-IP interactions.

This document establishes:

- The semantic model  
- Definitions of symbolic recursion  
- Alignment constraints  
- The Semantic Transport Layer interface  
- ABL compliance rules  
- Minimal requirements for any implementation  

---

# 2. Motivation
A protocol for ethical and aligned communication must rigorously define how meaning is represented, preserved, and validated.  
The ABL is the gatekeeper layer ensuring that:

- Content cannot be silently misaligned  
- Intent, context, and ethical flags are explicit  
- Semantic drift is detectable  
- Governance rules (RFC-0001) are enforceable at the boundary  

Without the ABL, the E-IP protocol would lack semantic integrity guarantees.

# 3. Semantic Architecture Overview
The Semantic Architecture defines:

1. **Symbolic Recursion Model**  
   Meaning is represented through recursively nested symbolic units, each with defined context, lineage, and interpretive rules.

2. **Meaning Graph**  
   A canonical directed graph representing relationships between symbols, intents, and contexts.

3. **Semantic Checksums**  
   A cryptographic summary representing meaning, not just text.

4. **Context Scopes**  
   Standardized scopes indicating how symbols must be interpreted (e.g., “regulatory”, “interpersonal”, “system-critical”).

5. **Ethical Flags**  
   Machine-readable markers that assert requirements (e.g., human review, consent, risk sensitivity).

# 4. Alignment Boundary Layer (ABL)

## 4.1 Purpose
The ABL is the enforcement layer that validates **alignment**, **ethics**, and **semantic correctness** before any content enters the Semantic Transport Layer (STL).

## 4.2 Responsibilities
The ABL must:

- Validate the **alignment_envelope**  
- Compute or verify the **semantic_checksum**  
- Check required **ethical flags**  
- Record lineage and context  
- Emit **alignment_status** and **risk_score**  
- Pass only validated packets to the STL  

## 4.3 Alignment Envelope (Core Object)
Every packet entering E-IP must carry an `alignment_envelope` containing:

```json
{
  "intent": "...",
  "context_scope": "...",
  "semantic_checksum": "...",
  "ethical_flags": [],
  "lineage": {
    "parent_ids": []
  },
  "risk_score": 0.0
}

---

## 5. Semantic Transport Layer (STL)

The Semantic Transport Layer (STL) provides transport, routing, and integrity guarantees for semantic packets validated by the ABL.

The ABL hands validated packets to the STL with the following guarantees:

- **alignment_status** = "valid"
- **sgl_version** (from RFC-0003 L0) is attached
- **lineage** is complete and append-only
- **risk_flags** are present and immutable
- **ethical_flags** are preserved

The STL is responsible for routing and lineage-preserving transport but **cannot override ABL judgments**.

### 5.1 STL Responsibilities

- Encapsulate semantic objects in transport-safe envelopes  
- Provide consistent serialization and deserialization  
- Preserve semantic lineage and integrity metadata  
- Enforce ABL alignment constraints during transmission  
- Provide hooks for governance, audits, and compliance  

---

### 5.2 STL Envelope Format

Each semantic packet MUST contain the following fields:
