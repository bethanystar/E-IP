## 📌 RFC Numbering Rules (Summary)
- Foundational RFCs start at `0001`.
- Year-based RFCs follow the format `YYYY-XXX`.
- Example / non-authoritative RFCs must explicitly include “example” in title.
- Supersession is handled by adding metadata at the top of each RFC.

Full rules are in: `/RFC/NUMBERING-RULES.md`.

## 📎 Notes
- This index must be updated every time an RFC enters a new state.
- Pull requests that modify RFCs must include an update to this file.
