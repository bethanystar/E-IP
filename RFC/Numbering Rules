# RFC Numbering Rules — PHAROS Ethical Stack

RFCs use a **four-digit sequential numbering system** that reflects time of submission, not importance.

Example:
```
0001-initial-governance.md
0007-semantic-layer-extensions.md
0142-meta-alignment-checks.md
```

---

## 1. Rules

### Rule 1 — Sequential assignment
- When submitting a new RFC, contributors must use the **next available number**.
- Do not reuse or skip numbers.

### Rule 2 — Slug format
Use lowercase with hyphens:
```
####-short-descriptive-title.md
```

Examples:
- `0043-drift-detection-protocol.md`
- `0090-compliance-audit-layer.md`

### Rule 3 — One RFC per file
No combined proposals.

### Rule 4 — Immutable numbering
Numbers never change, even if:
- The RFC is withdrawn  
- Rejected  
- Replaced by a newer RFC  

### Rule 5 — Errors
If an RFC is mis-numbered:
- Maintainers rename it  
- Add note to changelog  

---

## 2. Reserved Numbers

The following ranges are reserved:

- **0001–0099** → Foundational RFCs  
- **0100–0199** → Semantic / interpretational layers  
- **0200–0299** → Tooling & validators  
- **0300–0399** → Governance & meta-protocols  

These are conventions, not strict requirements.

## 3. Index File

An `RFC_INDEX.md` file lists:
- RFC number  
- Title  
- Status (Draft, Accepted, Rejected, Withdrawn)  
- Link  

Maintainers update it after merges.
