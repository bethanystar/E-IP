# E-IP Specification Directory

The **SPEC** directory contains the core technical specifications, schemas, and protocol definitions for the Ethical Internet Protocol (E-IP).  
These documents define how systems encode intent, ethics, transparency, and alignment into verifiable structures that can be transmitted, audited, and governed.

## Contents

### **Schemas**
These JSON schemas define the canonical data structures for E-IP:
- **manifest.schema.json** – Defines an Ethics Manifest, which captures actor intent, commitments, and declared boundaries.
- **decisionlog.schema.json** – Defines the structure for decision logs and traceability events.
- **modelcard.schema.json** – Defines the standard model card format for transparency, governance, and ethical disclosures.

### **Protocol Drafts**
These are the foundational documents describing how E-IP functions as a protocol:
- **eip-protocol.md** – Core protocol description and the conceptual framing.
- **rfc-style-mvp.md** – RFC-style MVP outlining the first open-source standard.
- **comparison-governance.md** – Comparison between existing governance frameworks and E-IP.

### **New Protocol Documents (Core Layer)**
- **eip-layer-stack.md** – Defines the full architecture of the E-IP layer stack.
- **eip-packet-structure.md** – Defines the Ethical Packet (E-Packet) structure and transmission rules.
- **eip-compliance-rules.md** – Defines compliance, verification logic, and governance rules.

## Purpose

The SPEC directory provides everything required for:
- Implementers to encode E-IP structures
- Researchers to extend or analyze the protocol
- Organizations to evaluate compliance
- Contributors to propose changes via RFCs

This directory is the **source of truth** for all protocol-level definitions.
