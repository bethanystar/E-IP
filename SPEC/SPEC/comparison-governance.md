# E-IP Comparison With Existing Governance Frameworks

## 1. Overview

E-IP is a *protocol*, not a governance philosophy or compliance framework.  
Below is how it compares to common alternatives.

## 2. Comparison Table

| Framework / Tool | Purpose | E-IP Relationship |
|------------------|---------|------------------|
| **IEEE EAD** | Ethical design standards | E-IP transports these standards as metadata |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management | E-IP provides the packet/logging mechanism |
| **Model Cards** | Model documentation | E-IP links decision metadata dynamically |
| **RLHF / Safety Tuning** | Behavior shaping | E-IP measures and verifies behavior |
| **Blockchain Governance** | Immutable ledgers | E-IP uses lightweight DAG/Merkle logs |
| **Federated Learning** | Distributed training | Not required; E-IP is transport only |
| **Trust & Safety Systems** | Internal guardrails | E-IP standardizes traceability |

## 3. Key Differentiators

### 3.1 Transport Layer, Not Policy
E-IP defines how ethical information moves, not what it must contain.

### 3.2 Vendor-Neutral and Interoperable
Compatible with any agent, model, or ecosystem.

### 3.3 Minimalistic and Scalable
Can run in small local systems or global networks.

### 3.4 Built for Multi-Agent Environments
Consensus and verification are native features.

## 4. Summary

E-IP complements compliance frameworks, safety methods, and governance models.  
It provides a universal ethical transport layer that none of the existing approaches supply.
