# E-IP Layer Stack Specification

The E-IP layer stack defines the architectural model of the Ethical Internet Protocol.  
It is analogous to the OSI or TCP/IP stack, but oriented around **intent, ethics, alignment, and transparency** instead of network transmission.

---

## **L0 – Symbolic Substrate Layer (LDT Core)**
The foundation of E-IP.  
This layer provides the ontological and semantic primitives derived from **Language-as-Dimension Theory (LDT)** that enable symbol encoding, recursion, and semantic compression.

Functions:
- Defines symbolic boundaries
- Provides universal units of meaning
- Enables semantic hashing and intent encoding

---

## **L1 – Identity & Intent Layer**
Encodes the actor, the actor’s intent, and the ethical context.

Functions:
- Actor identity (human, machine, collective)
- Intent declaration
- Context framing
- Ethical prerequisites and disclaimers

Artifacts:
- Identity Claim  
- Intent Envelope  

---

## **L2 – Manifest Layer**
This layer holds the **Ethics Manifest**, the primary declaration of commitments, constraints, and intended impact.

Functions:
- Generate and update manifests
- Define responsibility boundaries
- Express non-negotiables and ethical invariants

Artifacts:
- manifest.schema.json  

---

## **L3 – Decision Layer**
Captures events, decisions, and system behaviors in real time.

Functions:
- Traceability logs
- Rationales and evidence
- Environmental/contextual factors
- Decision hash linking

Artifacts:
- decisionlog.schema.json  

---

## **L4 – Transparency Layer**
Creates a standardized transparency envelope for any system, model, or process.

Functions:
- Model reporting
- Data provenance
- Risk/impact disclosures
- Update tracking

Artifacts:
- modelcard.schema.json  

---

## **L5 – Alignment Verification Layer**
This is the “compliance engine” of E-IP.

Functions:
- Intent–behavior alignment scoring
- Ethical invariants checks
- Governance rule execution
- Semantic validation

Artifacts:
- eip-compliance-rules.md  

---

## **L6 – Governance Interface Layer**
The interface for organizations, users, and auditors.

Functions:
- Human-in-the-loop approvals
- Governance dashboards
- Oversight routing
- Policy injection (top-down or local)

Artifacts:
- Templates and governance frameworks (in /GOVERNANCE)
