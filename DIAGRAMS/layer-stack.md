# E-IP Layer Stack Diagram Explanation

## Overview
The E-IP Layer Stack represents the vertical architecture of the protocol. It builds on the analogy of TCP/IP but introduces an "ethical substrate layer" responsible for alignment, semantics, and transparent governance.

## Layers

### 1. **Semantic Layer (Base Layer)**
- Defines terminology, meaning constraints, and symbolic coherence.
- Prevents semantic drift across systems.
- Ensures consistent definitions across manifests, decision logs, and alignment documents.

### 2. **Alignment Layer (Middle Layer)**
- Enforces ethical boundaries and contextual constraints.
- Evaluates agency, consent integrity, and risk exposure.
- Uses manifests and schemas to validate system behavior.

### 3. **Governance Layer (Top Layer)**
- Manages change control, RFC process, maintainers, and formal approvals.
- Ensures transparent evolution of the protocol.

The vertical stack ensures changes ripple upward and downward with traceability.

## Key Insight
Unlike TCP/IP where layers handle *data*, E-IP layers handle:
- Meaning  
- Ethics  
- Governance  

This establishes E-IP as the world’s first protocol whose purpose is safety, alignment, and transparent intent.
