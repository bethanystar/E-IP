# Alignment Boundary Layer Diagram Explanation

## Purpose
The Boundary Layer provides runtime constraints that contain system behavior within defined ethical and contextual limits.

### Key Components:
- **Allowed Contexts**
- **Forbidden Contexts**
- **Behavior Thresholds**
- **Drift Alerts**
- **Escalation Rules**
- **Safeguard Requirements**

The diagram shows how the Boundary Layer sits between operational logic and allowed ethical space.

It ensures:
- Agents cannot cross domain lines without approval  
- High-risk transitions trigger mandatory alignment review  
- Human oversight is invoked when constraints are exceeded
