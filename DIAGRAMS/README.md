# Diagrams

This folder contains all visual models and architectural diagrams used throughout the E-IP specification. These diagrams define the conceptual, structural, and functional relationships between the Governance, Alignment, and Semantic Layers, as well as protocol flows, agent interactions, and cross-layer dependencies.

Diagrams in this folder include:
1. `layer-stack.png` – The E-IP Layered Architecture
2. `protocol-flow.png` – Core E-IP Message and Validation Flow
3. `alignment-boundary-layer.png` – Boundary enforcement and ethical constraints
4. `semantic-recursion-model.png` – Symbolic recursion and meaning control in LDT
5. `governance-process.png` – Cross-layer decision-making diagram
6. `manifest-life-cycle.png` – How manifests move through the protocol
7. `decision-log-flow.png` – How decisions get created, reviewed, finalized

Each diagram is paired with a corresponding `.md` file explaining its meaning and structure.
