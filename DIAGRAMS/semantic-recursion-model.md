# Semantic Recursion Model (Based on LDT)

E-IP integrates principles of Language-as-Dimension Theory (LDT) to enforce semantic coherence and prevent symbolic drift.

## Diagram Explanation

The diagram illustrates:

1. **Base Symbols** → Primitive distinctions
2. **Symbolic Recursion** → Layers of meaning-building
3. **Curvature Formation** → Contextual shaping of meaning
4. **Semantic Stability** → Maintaining meaning integrity in evolving systems
5. **Drift Detection** → Alerts when meaning deviates from approved definitions

## Why This Matters
Semantics is not just a glossary.  
It's the foundation that determines:
- What an action *means*  
- Whether behavior stays aligned  
- Whether intent remains interpretable  

E-IP uses LDT-based semantic recursion to ground meaning consistently across systems.
